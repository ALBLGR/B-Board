# B-Board

This is a semi-open source web-site of Eno served for multiple purpose.

The /console and /wechat-program sub-folders serves for Arduino robotics control purpose.

The /play sub-folder is a JavaScript based HTML5 simple game, reproducing a Shakesprean piece Hamlet. The video payload is NOT INCLUDED, segments of the scenes should be put together into a single file for better streaming and navigation. It is to be updated soon as I will complete it for my AP English Language and Composition course final project.
